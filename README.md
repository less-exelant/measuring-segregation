# **Segregation Metrics and Housing Equity Repository**

This repository analyzes segregation patterns and quantifies the impact of housing policies using advanced metrics and geospatial analysis. It supports fair housing claims and evaluates the impact of preemption laws like Florida’s Live Local Act (LLA) on housing equity.
